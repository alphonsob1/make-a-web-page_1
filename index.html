        <h2>How the Web Works</h2>
          <p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like <a href="http://www.google.com"> <img src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/Wx1OdscqyJkXh3vYLx6ZTxngP542hK_P2Mew1MvItbCs-GF4a0lyBfFSOfebDt9CX4Fv-omaDshdYX_obLI9=s90#w=130&h=60" alt="www.google.com"></a> 
          their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
          <p>HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>. 
          HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. 
          HTML documents contain text content which describes <strong>"what you see"</strong> and markup which describes <strong><em>"how it looks"</em></strong>.

        <h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
          HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>.
          When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <em><b>tags</b></em>.<br>

        <h2>Computers are Stupid</h2>
          <p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</p>

        <h2>Inline vs Block Elements </h2>
          <p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>

        <h2>Developer Tools (in the Browser)</h2>
          <p>HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>

      <h2>The "tree-like structure" of HTML </h2>
        <p>The <b>"tree-like structure"</b> comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...<br> 
        In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...</p>

      <div class="notes">
        <h2>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</h2>
          <p>When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.</p>

        <h2>Page Structure Overview</h2>
           <p>HTML controls the "structure" of a     web page.<br>
             CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).</p>

        <h2>What is CSS</h2>
          <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets. CSS defines how HTML elements are to be displayed.  Inheritance is a key feature in CSS, it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.</p>

      <h2>How do I include CSS Styling in my web page</h2>
        <p>CSS can be contained within an html file, by writing the css in the <em>head</em> of the html file. This method is good for very small projects.<br><br> To do this: <br>1. At the top of your HTML document, add a <em>head</em> element.<br>
        2. Inside the <em>head</em> element, add a <em>style</em> element.<br> 3. Write your CSS in the <em>style</em> element and then put the HTML for the rest of your page below.</p>
        <p>Or you can Link your HTML to a separate CSS file. his adds another step, but it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects.<br><br> To do this: 1. Write all of your structural HTML in one html file.<br>
          2. In a separate css file put all of your css code.<br>
          3. Add a <em>head</em> element to the top of the HTML.<br>
          4. Add a <em>link</em> tag inside the <em>head</em> element.<br>
          5. Add the following attributes to the html in the <em>head</em> element:</p>  <pre>&lt;link&gt;: * rel="stylesheet" * type="text/css" * href="main.css"</pre>

        <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
        <p>Selectors are what allows you to       target specific HTML elements and       apply style to them. <br>

        <h2>Box Sizing and Positioning</h2>
          <h3>Box Sizing</h3>
            <p>HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.
            There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.<br>
            1. Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels.<br>
            2. Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.</p> 
            <p>Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.</p>
          <h3>Box Positioning</h3>
            <p>Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.<br>
            Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</p>
